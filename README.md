# volleyboard (Volleyboard Clipboard)
volleyboard (stands for Volleyball Clipboard) is a web-based application for coaches/managers to manage and analyze a volleyball team.

The development of this application was carried out for sake of my self-learn of web development, data analysis, statistics, or anything inside it.

Thank you Github for making this project saveable and editable everywhere.

This application is under construction.
